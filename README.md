## Objectives of the game

The objective of the game is very simple. Get to the water without hitting any of the bugs. 

The bugs run across the screen at different speeds. If you run into a bug, you will be automatically reset to the starting position.

There is no score or time involved, so just play it for fun!

## How to play the game

You can only control the Hero on the game board. Do this by using the up, down, left and right arrow keys. You cannot press and hold. 

## Run the game

Click on "Clone or Download" on this repository page and download it as ZIP. Extract the folder content and open "index.html" from a brownser for the game to run.
